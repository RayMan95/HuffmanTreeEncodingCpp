Thanks for using my genius piece of art!

1) Project Structure
All source code kept in main directory.
Test data used for test file kept in data directory.

*huffencode.h
	- Header file for project. Contains definitions for HuffmanNode and HuffmanTree classes

*HuffmanNode.cpp:
	- Definitions for HuffmanNode class - serves as nodes for the HuffmanTree
	- Holds a char and frequency, as well as 'shared_ptr's to left and right children

*HuffmanTree.cpp:
	- Definitions for HuffmanTree class - serves as tree and performs the encoding of the files
	- Holds a shared_ptr for the root, and holds various containers used for building the tree and encoding the files

*driver.cpp:
	- Driver class for project
	- Handles console I/O
	- Uses command-line args to run HuffmanTree methods
	- Provides output messages for progress of encoding

*test.cpp:
	- Test file containing catch.hpp header and all tests

2) Running Project
	1) Direct terminal to directory containing project files (driver.cpp, HuffmanTree.cpp, etc.)
	2) Run command: make
	3) Run command: huffencode <inputFile> <outputFile>
		- inputFile is the name of the inputfile to encode
		- outputFile is the name of the resulting encoded file
		- NB: relative paths must be provided for files
	4) To run Catch test, run command: make test
		- NB: this requires that the command 'make' has already been run
		- All output of the test is sent to ./data/catch_output.inf
